# Ari Sample Applications

You will need to replace the placeholder value for `ari_license_key` inside the
`src/main/res/values/strings.xml` of each app in this repository with your
actual Ari license key. Other than that, the sample apps here will work out of
the box.

If you have any questions, please consult the Ari SDK documentation at the [Ari
Developer Portal](https://www.otgplatforms.com/developers/overview/) or email
[support@otgplatforms.com](mailto:support@otgplatforms.com).
